<!--<h1> Welcome to my Portfolio site!</h1>

<p>Here I hope to house professional, educational, and fun projects I felt help me grow as an individual.</p>-->

<!--<h1>Purpose</h1>-->
<h1>üëã Hi There</h1>

<p>Within this site, I have shared artifacts from my M.A journey, professional, teaching, and personal experience. There are resources as well that students or any individuals interested in <b>Technical Writing</b>.</p>

<p>All of my work should reflect my commitment to the learning outcomes of my M.A program:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate mastery of craft through attention to detail</li>

<li>Be able to analyze and create documents that work best to a wide range of rhetorical situations</li>

<li>Use technology to effectively create and deliver content</li>

<li>Understand the history and major theories of my profession; knowing how the rules were created and have changed</li>

<li>Conduct primary and secondary research that can contribute knkowledge to my field</li>

<li>Participate in profession beyond classroom</li>

<li>Conduct myself in a professional manor </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in reviewing my resume or checking out my professional experience outside of these artifacts, checkout my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanner-sullivan-184491121/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3B%2BWCNEXP5RjqwoVrS5yETYg%3D%3D" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>. Even if I am not looking for a new job, I am always on the lookout for fun projects!</p>

<h1>üëì Have a Look Around</h1>

<p> This portfolio also houses some of my work in higher-education and explorative, fun, projects. I am so thankful to the open-source community for which this site wouldn't be possible. I use many tools as well on my machine for quality-of-life enhancements (or must-haves).</p>

<p>These artifact pages are also accessible from the navigation or by searching from any page on this site. </p>

<p> With quite a bit of work behind me, I have a lot of work ahead of me. But no where in this portfolio site do I claim to be perfect. On the contrary, I showcase some of those rough-edges to highlight or explain my growth. Reflecting on my work helps me to contextualize any skills or processes involved in these new experiences.</p>

<p>I hope to continue advancing my technical skills and find ways to give back or creatively contribute to the community. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
