<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hello hello</h1>

<p>Welcome to my portfolio site. My name is Tanner Sullivan and I am yet another bald Pokemon catching, scifi loving, child of the internet. This site demonstrates my accomplishments as a student, educator, and professional (with a few fun projects too).</p>

<p>All of my work should reflect my commitment to the learning outcomes of UALR's Professional and Technical Writing program:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate mastery of craft through attention to detail</li>

<li>Be able to analyze and create documents that work best to a wide range of rhetorical situations</li>

<li>Use technology to effectively create and deliver content</li>

<li>Understand the history and major theories of my profession; knowing how the rules were created and have changed</li>

<li>Conduct primary and secondary research that can contribute knowledge to my field</li>

<li>Participate in profession beyond classroom</li>

<li>Conduct myself in a professional manner</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in reviewing my resume or checking out my professional experience outside of these artifacts, checkout my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanner-sullivan-184491121/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3B%2BWCNEXP5RjqwoVrS5yETYg%3D%3D" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>. I am always on the lookout for fun projects!</p>
