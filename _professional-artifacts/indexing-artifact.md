# Project Description

For my final indexing project, I selected a Robohelp project I created with a group during the RHET Writing Software Documentation course. This project was a two part guide for planning, recording, and editing instructional videos. The target audience included UALR instructors that create online instructional content. This guide included how-to content for popular tools such as Adobe Captivate and Techsmith's Camtasia. 

## Learning Outcomes

- Analyze and respond to the needs of our audience (guide users) around an index
- Understand and apply major theories behind the profession
- Utilize Robohelp to create and deliver content
