# Project Description

In my Writing for Business and Government class, students were expected to work in groups to create company policies with internal and external facing support materials (such as a press release and internal notice or SOP).

This was a group project between myself and Eric Grover. We both selected the "Anti-Bullying Policy" topic and worked to create a final polished policy with two supporting documents - a press release and a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for internal resources to refer to when filing a complaint.

A third document was created to symbolize a training event the company hosted. This document (independetly) was not a requirement of this project. It was academic research that indicated company investment in culture shifts were a must to make them long lasting.

## Learning Outcomes

- Create a variety of documents to support developing and implementing a workplace policy
- Analyze workplace scenarious around the subject-matter
- Conduct primary research around workplace policies to identify indistry standards in subject-matter approach
- Work with a teammate to coordinate tasks and deliver a polished product

# Reflection

Going into this class, I anticipated a surplus of dry research, laws, and business policies for reading and discussion. I didn't imagine the contact space government and business policy could create. However, that doesn't mean I was wrong; there was plenty of Plain Language theory and policy editing that prefaced this project.

Before forming groups, each student had to select a policy subject from a list and construct a rough draft based on their own constructed rhetorical situation. We could identify an existing business as our rhetorical situation our create our own. "Sullie Grove Co.," the business my group figuratively created, envisioned as a medium (local produce market) agriculture company that was in need of an anti-bullying policy.

We collaborated together and shared our research that informed our decisions for the first drafts using annotated bibliographies (academic journal entries and some web resources). These helped identify the "Dos, Don'ts, and Maybes" of workplace anti-bullying policies we each used to develop our own drafts. This research guided our decisions like what sections we needed to create and what level of detail we should aim to produce.
