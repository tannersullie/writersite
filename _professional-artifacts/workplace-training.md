# Project Description

This is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) created in response to an initiative to create reference and training videos. This SOP briefly introduced tools to capture graphics and screen recordings with respective how-to sections and a brief methodology for using sales/marketing language for specific solutions.

## Learning Outcomes

- Analyze and respond to rhetorical situations around creating support materials such as training videos
- Participate in the profession beyond the classroom by leveraging not only procedure writing but tutorial videos too
- Understand and apply major theories behind the profession, such as the writing process, audience analysis, and addressing specific user needs (situations)
- Utilize online technology to create and deliver content


# Reflection

I took Composition Theory during my graduate career and was lucky enough to teach. This experience gave me the first step to working with diverse groups of people and going over processes and concepts. However, training in the workplace was still a very different experience. 

Given the target industry, users had different levels of knowledge and based on *VERY* customizable software solutions. This inconsistency meant creating baseline materials on product education included covering all of what is possible, and then working with engineering to review specific implementations. This document did meet the goals I set out for it. Since I wasn't writing for a novice audience, I felt free to break down only some processes or steps. Employees quickly learned to configure and use the screen capturing tool and recording software to create a video. 

Including a "Project Tips" section was the most important to me as it called out (to summarize), "don't reinvent the wheel, let's standardize our language here" by encouraging employees to use existing resources. Though these videos were likely never to be externalized, it was essential to maintain a certain level of ethos. The easiest way to do this was to show where the desired language was already available. However, this SOP alone wasn't going to shift individuals from make-shift solutions such as making quick recordings from Zoom meeting recordings.

Implementing this procedure and making it a standard took working with teams individually and at a company level to train and establish buy-in. Technical writers can define existing processes, ideate on ways to improve them, and make fundamental changes. Looking back on this and various similar situations, I've learned that end-user buy-in is vital to change. There needs to be a clear path/approach to collecting that, but I've found one where others are included and allowed to contribute are the most likely to bear fruit.
