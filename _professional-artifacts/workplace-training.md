# Project Description

This is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) created in response to an initiative to create reference and training videos. This SOP briefly introduced tools to capture graphics and screen recording with respective how-to sections, and a brief methodology for using sales/marketing language for specific solutions.

Although I cannot give you access to the space, here is a PDF version. This SOP guides employees through creating valuable internal and customer training materials. This requires learning the methodology to construct a video (outline, presentation, etc.) and two new software tools: one for taking screenshots and another to record the video (both open source).

## Learning Outcomes

- Analyze and respond to rhetorical situations
- Participate in profession beyond classroom
- Understand and apply major theories behind profession
- Utilize online technology to create and deliver content


# Reflection

Being an instructor, I had to provide how-to materials for students either searched or self-authored. Because I asked students early in the semester about their technical literacy, I had a rough idea of my baseline in terms of required support materials. Creating a document like this, except for a whole company, had far more considerations and unknowns.

This document did meet the goals I set out for it. Since I wasn't writing for a novice audience, I didn't feel compelled to break down every process or step. Employees quickly learned how to configure and use the screen capturing tool and recording software to create a video. Project Tips was the most important to me as it was the "don't reinvent the wheel, let's standardize our language here" message.

Though a video may address a specific audience's needs, each created for the customers or the public needed to maintain or build the company's ethos. The easiest way to do this was to show where the desired language was already available. However, this SOP alone wasn't going to shift individuals from make-shift solutions such as making quick recordings from Zoom meeting recordings.
