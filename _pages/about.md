Graduating from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UALR) with a M.A. in Professional and Technical Writing proved to be more difficult than I originally thought. However, I do not regret the decision now seeing all the doors that additional time of refinement and polish open for me.


Tanner Sullivan holds a M.A. in Professional and Technical Writing from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Since graduating, they have held many positions that leverage writing for software such as a technical writer, product analyst, and even instructor. Tanner lives in Arkansas with his tabby cat, Rachel.

# Some Fun Details About Me

I am really into writing personal short stories, cooking (snacking), roaming the internet for nifty tools, playing games on my Switch, and doom scrolling peacefully to LoFi music.

## Herbivore looking for a Hot Stove

I am a vegetarian...

## I am a Pokemon Trainer!

Pokemon is probably one of my favorite game series. My first game was Pokemon Leaf Green, and I have continued to play! My favorite generation is probably Hoenn, and I tend to like grass types, but there is plenty of love for'em all. Though I enjoy many different games this series stays my favorite. See my favorite dream team below:
