# Herbivore Looking for a Hot Stove üå±

After a few years of working in the food industry and for my own health, I decided to become a vegetarian in 2019 and haven't looked back since. When people learn this, I often receive a confused look or a comment like, "_why_ give up bacon!?" Be it my extroverted side or the dopamine from talking about food, I am _always_ happy to talk about recipes and tons of healthy noms with others.

I don't want to yuck anyone's yum; I simply hope to share what I have learned - failures, successes, and all. Many recipes I've found are full of flavor while lower in oil. Where I find myself racing against time, unable to make a balanced meal, that's what the Impossible Nuggets or Beyond Brats are for - lil' something quick and yummy.

Next to sleeping, cooking is definitely of my favorite things to keep me busy. Those are probably my #1 and #2, respectively ü§£ Throughout my life, I've had a problematic relationship with food. My digestive system is tricky, but I crave spicy foods and savory flavors; sweets shouldn't rest peacefully because I have a tooth for them, too. 

You get it: I love spending my time in the kitchen.

## Favorite Cookbook üìö

Probably my go-to cookbook is [The Veganomicon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1059680.Veganomicon). Though there are plenty of eBooks lining my app's shelves, collecting dust-bytes, it is undoubtedly my favorite. There are tons of recipes to try, but the book is SUPER well organized. I love using it as an example in my Writing Software Documentation course - highlighting the information design. I call to this masterpiece like Winifred calls for Book:

# Burning Through my Free Time üò¥

If you've ever watched Bob's Burgers and remember Mr. Fischoeder's song, [Nothing Makes Me Happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTw_WzFh9Vk), well, my number is up. I love having periods of free time where I can simply let my mind wander and focus drift. The trouble is, between those periods, I NEED something to do. Everything has an expiration to how long it can hold my attention - including nothing. 



## So Pokemon üëæ

Pokemon is my favorite game series I've ever played, as they've kept my attention for _ALL_ these years. My first game was Pokemon Leaf Green, and I have continued to play! My favorite generation is either Hoenn or Kalos. (Fuse them together and just give me ORAS if I am being honest.) As I build teams, I tend to favor Grass and Normal types more, but I have plenty of favorites amongst every type and generation.

There are many Pokemon I love and friends I've made from playing the game. Trying to select only six was very difficult  (nearly impossible tbh), but I was able to pair it down... somehow üò©

<center>{% include feature_row %}</center>

I never played competitively, but I used to train Pokemon and build teams to battle my brother. It was one of the few things we shared an interest in. Lately, I've played a lot of Pokemon Legends Arceus, but I am looking forward to the Scarlet/Violet games!

# A Writer Learning to Love Writing üßë‚Äçüíª

When I was in high school, and my Civics teacher had us go through the "in 5yrs... in 10yrs..." exercise (selecting career paths and planning for a *successful* life), I did not have "writer" on the list. Both professionally and personally, writing does not come easily to me. 

![Animated hands reaching for each other]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hands-reaching.jpg){: .align-right} I take a lot of time to reflect and think, but taking something out of my universe and putting it into this one can take quite a bit of energy. However, somehow my Composition 2 instructor and later chair for my graduate portfolio, Dr. Rankins-Robertson, convinced me that I had a knack for it.
 Yet, here I am writing and compiling a portfolio using Jekyll (and the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) - thank you, Michael). 

So, of course, lightning has struck along the way. I found my inspiration be it working with engineers and other SMEs to document or ideate solutions, teaching students, or noodle'n (thinking/brainstorming) and jotting a few ideas down for myself. 

## Aspiring to be Inspired üí°

My bread and butter lies where *everyone* cringes - documentation. Be it engineers I work with who complained about having to (endlessly) repeat the process to nail down the steps, or end users who imagine working with engineers or SMEs is like making a trip to "over-stimulation-land." (I go there often, but that's just me manaing my ADD poorly, haha.)

Whelp, they are all wrong... and right, but there is a zest to it I cannot resist. I enjoy learning about the solutions engineers develop. Be it the earlier in the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) with ideation or later with technical documentation, I enjoy the *madness*. Going through conversations to learn and understand details around an enhancement meets my needs to help me to write confidently. 

# Sharing a Few Final Thoughts üí≠

Thank you for reading! I appreciate your time üôè and hope you continue to get to know me through my writing. If work around technical documentation seems interesting to you too, or other forms of non-fiction writing, consider taking a look at the <a href="https://ualr.edu/rhetoric" target="_blank">UALR Professional and Technical Writing Program</a>. I found UALR to be a diverse and wonderful place to start my education and continue it and further my development.

## And Don't Forget to Vote! üó≥Ô∏è

![Diverse group of animated people holding signs to encourage voting](/assets/images/voting-peeps.jpg)

It *should* go without saying, yet so many people don't believe in the power of voting. For every election, mid-terms, general, etc., exercising the power you hold as a citizen is essential. Your voice matters. We may not always agree, but voting is where we can lay it all out and fairly decide the following approach. *What* you use to guide your choices is up to you!
