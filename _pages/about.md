If I had to cliff-note my own "about me," I would probably give readers something like the following:

- Received my **Master of Arts** in Professional and Technical Writing and Online Writing Instruction **Graduate Certificate** from UALR üßë‚Äçüéì

- **+5 yrs** of experience as a **Technical Writer** üßë‚Äçüíª

- **+2 yrs** of experience as a **Product Professional** ü¶π

- **+2 yrs** of teaching **Writing Software Documentation** at UALR üßë‚Äçüè´

- üíñ my cats, Rachel (who is the sweetest üòª) and Peaches (well, the sweetest hellion, haha)

## A writer learning to love writing üìë

When I was in high school, and my US Civics teacher had us go through the "in 5yrs... in 10yrs..." exercise (selecting career paths and planning for a *successful* life), I did not have "writer" on the list. Both professionally and personally, writing does not come easily to me. Especially at a time where most of my exposure to writing was only around book reports, picking this career out of a line-up would _never_ happen.

![Animated hands reaching for each other]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/hands-reaching.jpg){: .align-right style="border: 1px solid black;"} However with a lot of practice, exposure to standards, and noted help, I've found success. I take a lot of time to reflect and think, but once I understand the subject at hand and have a great team to work with, nothing can stop me. None of this would've been possible without my Composition 2 instructor and later chair, Dr. Rankins-Robertson, convinced me that I had a knack for it.
 Yet, here I am writing and compiling a portfolio using Jekyll (and the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) - thank you, Michael).

So, of course, lightning has struck by way of listening and studying Youtube/Udemy videos along the way. I found my inspiration be it working with engineers or SMEs to build amazing solutions and students on my favorite subject - software documentation.

My bread and butter lies where *everyone* cringes - documentation; entering Dante's inferno by repeating a process over-and-over again only to repeat the process next release. Some engineers cringe at the idea of reviewing a single process so much while users might think it is difficult or impossible to talk with techninal resources.

Whelp, they are all wrong, for the most part, haha. I enjoy working with engineers to ask questions and learn more about the functionality they created so I can help users to learn exactly _how_ to use it once released. Plus, engaging with new processes and tooling always stimulates my hyper-focus. There are days where I am processed-out, but that just means it is tea time. Be it the earlier in the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) with ideation or later with technical documentation, I enjoy the *madness*.

## Some fun stuff üëæ

If you've ever watched Bob's Burgers and remember Mr. Fischoeder's song, [Nothing Makes Me Happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTw_WzFh9Vk), well, my number is up. I love having periods of free time where I can simply let my mind wander and focus drift. The trouble is, between those periods, I **NEED** something to do. _Everything_ has an expiration to how long it can hold my attention, including nothing.

Pokemon is my favorite game series, as they've kept my attention for _ALL_ these years. My first game was Pokemon Leaf Green, and hooked ever since! My favorite generation is either Hoenn or Kalos. As I build teams, I tend to favor Grass and Normal types more, but I have plenty of favorites among every type and generation.

There are many Pokemon I love and friends I've made from playing the games. Trying to select only six was very difficult  (nearly impossible tbh), but I was able to pair it down... somehow üò©

I never played competitively, but I would train teams up to play with my friends. Lately, I've played a lot of Pokemon Legends Arceus, but I am looking forward to the future!

## Herbivore looking for a hot stove üå±

After a few years of working in the food industry and for my own health, I decided to become a vegetarian in 2019 and haven't looked back since. When people learn this, I often receive a confused look or a comment like, "_why_ give up bacon!?" Be it my extroverted side or the dopamine from talking about food, I am _always_ happy to talk about recipes and tons of healthy noms with others.

I don't want to yuck anyone's yum; I simply hope to share what I have learned - failures, successes, and all. Many recipes I've found are full of flavor while lower in oil. Where I find myself racing against time, unable to make a balanced meal, that's what the Impossible Nuggets or Beyond Brats are for - lil' something quick and yummy.

You get it: I love spending my time in the kitchen. It helps me workout my thoughts while the final product results in a delicious meal (or dessert).

Probably my go-to cookbook is [The Veganomicon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1059680.Veganomicon). Though there are plenty of eBooks lining my app's shelves, collecting dust-bytes, it is undoubtedly my favorite. There are tons of recipes to try, but the book is SUPER well organized. (It is one of the best eBooks I've had the pleasure of using.) I love using it as an example in my Writing Software Documentation course - highlighting the information design. I call to this masterpiece like Winifred calls for Book:

<center><div style="width:50%"><div style="height:0;padding-bottom:62.410071942446045%;position:relative;width:100%"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameBorder="0" height="100%" src="https://giphy.com/embed/fcNiVhbiet9UFsdJK5/video" style="left:0;position:absolute;top:0;" width="100%"></iframe></div></div></center>

<br/>

The pizza and pie dough recipes are probably my go-to with a runner-up being the oatmeal cookies.
