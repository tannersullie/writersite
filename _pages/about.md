# Herbivore looking for a Hot Stove

After a few years of working in the food industry and for my own health, I decided to become a vegetarian in 2019 and haven't looked back since. ![Meme of woman holding watermelon at party with caption "When you're the only vegan at a party and gotta bring ur own food"]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IMG_9814.png){: .align-right} Most of the times I share this, I get a confused look, "_why_ give up bacon!?" is probably the number-one reaction. I will say, be it my extroverted side or the dopamine that comes from talking about food, I am _always_ happy to talk about recipes and tons of healthy noms I've discovered.

I don't want to yuck anyone's yum, I just simply hope to share what I've learned. A lot of the recipes I've found are full of flavor while lower in oil. It isn't always easy, but that's what the Impossible Nuggets or Beyond Brats are for - lil' something quick.

Next to sleeping, cooking is definitely of my favorite things to keep me busy. Those are probably my #1 and #2, respectively ðŸ¤£ Throughout my life, I've had a difficult relationship with food. My digestive system is a bit sensitive, but I have a taste for spicy foods and savory flavors; but sweets shouldn't rest peacefully because I have a tooth for them too, haha. You get it - I love spending my time in the kitchen

## Favorite Cookbook

Probably my go-to cook book is [The Veganomicon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1059680.Veganomicon). Though there are plenty of eBooks lining my app's shelves, collecting dust, it is without a doubt my favorite. Not only are there tons of recipes to try, but the book is SUPER well organized. I love using it as an example as I've taught Writing Software Documentation too. I call to this masterpiece like Winifred calls for Book:

# Keeping Gaming Casual

Lorem ipsum

## So Pokemon

Pokemon is probably my favorite game series I've ever played, as they've kept my attention for _ALL_ these years. My first game was Pokemon Leaf Green, and I have continued to play! My favorite generation is probably either Hoenn or Kalos (or just ORAS if I am being honest). I tend to like grass and normal types, but I have plenty of favorites amongst every type and generation.

There are many Pokemon I love and friends I've made from playing the game. Trying to select only six was very difficult  (nearly impossible tbh), but I was able to pair it down... somehow ðŸ˜©

<center>{% include feature_row %}</center>

I never played competitively, but I used to train Pokemon and build teams for my brother and I to play together. It was one of the few things we shared too. Lately I've played a lot of Pokemon Legends Arceus, but I am looking forward to the Scarlet/Violet games!
