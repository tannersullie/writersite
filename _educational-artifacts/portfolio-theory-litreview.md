# Project Description

In this review of literature, I focus on the development of portfolio evaluation and some of its early revisions. The literature starts by identifying the needs that portfolio evaluation seeks to address, defining what a portoflio is for context, the initial development of portfolios, and then improvements made down the road (whenin a specific frame).

Here is a .PDF of this Literature Review. Because this was only a section of a larger thesis proposal, it does have elements most literature reviews have such as a cover page and page breaks.

## Learning Outcomes

- Analyze and respond to rhetorical situations
- Conduct primary research
- Utillize online technology to create and deliver content


# Reflection

The original purpose of this literature review was to identify the intent instructors had behind implementing portfolio evaluation and motivators to develop it further. My goal was to establish the problem portfolios sought to solve and to capture student attitudes towards portfolio evaluation.

I struggled a lot with my initial research dive to narrow my supporting topics. I knew that establishing the precedent was critical for this review because the phases involved in improving or redefining processes to teach and evaluate portfolios could answer my research questions. What were student attitudes toward portfolio evaluation? What were they taking away, if anything at all, from the portfolio assignment?
