# Project Description

After my first teaching experience, I signed up for the OWI program to further reflect on my experience and improve as a future educator. With a lot of flexibility, learners get to choose the situation they address. The class I focused on creating for was Composition 1 (or a first-year writing course).

Program Learning outcomes blah and what my goals were for leaving the program

Below are snippets of my work throughout the OWI program. They include:

- Learning outcome sheet
- Google Site project for an online course creation project
- Lesson plan draft fueling the Google Site
- A revised Composition 1 course syllabus
- Learner Audience Analysis - Scenario Planning

## Learning Outcomes

- Lorem Ipsum


# Reflection

The work in this course taught me how to use different modes of communication to work with students in an online environment. This communication can go beyond an online-only environment to a hybrid environment. This allows me, as an instructor, to communicate with my students in different ways (e.g., video lessons) to reach them more effectively than just comments on a paper or written feedback.

I was able to take what the introduction course taught and work these goals into specific assignments. I didn’t learn as much about accessibility as I wanted to, which may require me to use the software or work with disability services to “walk a mile in someone else’s shoes.” In terms of making content available for students, I utilized Working in Google Sites to build an online class in such a short time felt vastly different from teaching in a hybrid course.

Outside of the Composition class, the work throughout this program helped me to be a better technical writer. Working with learners from across the world, I couldn’t just send SOPs covering software functionality. To successfully teach new processes, I had to work with learners to gain insight into their duties and responsibilities to contextualize the software solution. Without a Learning Management System (LMS), I only had access to email communication and document organization to create a full training plan.
