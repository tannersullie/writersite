# Project Description

Completed a graduate certificate that provides writing teachers with graduate-level accredited professional development hours specifically in online writing instruction (OWI). Each course in the program built on one another, leveraging concepts and even work to develop a full online writing class.

## Learning Outcomes

- Continue to independently improve on OWI principles and effective strategies
- Create professional materials and strategies to build an online writing course for learners
- Continue to identify ways to embrace diversity
- Design for accessibility
- Share information that can help advance the OWI community

The work in this course taught me how to use different modes of communication to work with students in an online environment. This communication can go beyond an online-only environment to a hybrid environment. This allows me, as an instructor, to communicate with my students in different ways (e.g., video lessons) to reach them more effectively than just comments on a paper or written feedback.

I was able to take what the introduction course taught and work these goals into specific assignments. I didn’t learn as much about accessibility as I wanted to, which may require me to use the software or work with disability services to “walk a mile in someone else’s shoes.” In terms of making content available for students, I utilized Working in Google Sites to build an online class in such a short time felt vastly different from teaching in a hybrid course.

Outside of the Composition class, the work throughout this program helped me to be a better technical writer. Working with learners from across the world, I couldn’t just send SOPs covering software functionality. To successfully teach new processes, I had to work with learners to gain insight into their duties and responsibilities to contextualize the software solution. Without a Learning Management System (LMS), I only had access to email communication and document organization to create a full training plan.
